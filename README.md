Hi!
My name is Nate Leon Guerrero.<br>
This is an integrated example with the popular Northwind Database <br>
Within this example, I will compare the use of sqldf vs. pandas <br>
<br>
sqldf is a great tool for those that prefer to stick with SQL to analyze their data. <br>
It is also great for when you need to perform complicated joins amongst tables or complicated aggregations that would be difficult to perform in pandas alone
